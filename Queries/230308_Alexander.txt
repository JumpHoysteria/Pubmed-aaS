START_COMMENT:
EXPLANATION: 
	This PUBMED-query screens for generally interesting papers for our group, based on keywords, author lists, exclusion criteria and date of publication.
	The query can be copied into PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) as is, but without the /** ... **/ part.

DOCUMENTATION: 
	1. NOT-Block: 
		Has to be put to the end and follows the following syntax
		((((Query[Dates, Keywords, Authors]) NOT (Yeast)) NOT (Cancer)) NOT (Invertebrates)) NOT (Insects)) NOT (Plants)
	2. DATE:
		The DATE-Format in the Query below is YYYY/MM/DD. So "2021/03/24" is March 24th 2021.

NOTES
Alexander explicitly wanted me to keep in the news articles.
